Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]);
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

after 3 seconds Promise.all finishes. Wait for all of them to finish.
o/p: [val1,val2,val3]



Promise.all([p1,p2,p3]);
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

but after 1 second p2 get rejected, then Promise.all will throw error.
O/p: error
It will not wait for other promises.






Promise.allSettled([p1,p2,p3])
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

If all them succefully executed after 3 seconds.



Promise.allSettled([p1,p2,p3]);
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

but after 1 second p2 get rejected,then still wait for all promises to settled.
after 3 seconds it will give output as [val1, error, val3];






Promise.race([p1,p2,p3]);
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

output:
after 1s -> (val2) value of the first settled promise
after 2s -> (val3) value of the second settled promise
after 3s -> (val1) value of the third settled promise







Promise.race([p1,p2,p3]);
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

but if p2 gets rejected

output:
after 1s -> (error) return result of first settled promise
It will not wait for other promises get settled. same as promise.all()







Promise.any([p1,p2,p3]);

wait for first success.
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

output: [val2] as output, won't wait for other promises








Promise.any([p1,p2,p3]);

wait for first success.
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

If p2 gets rejected, then it will this promise and go for next promise

output: [val3] as output, won't wait for other promises






Promise.any([p1,p2,p3]);

wait for first success.
if p1 takes 3 seconds to complete,
p2 takes 1 second to complete,
p3 takes 2 seconds to complete.

If all of the promises get rejected
output: Aggregated error
[err1,err2,err3]
