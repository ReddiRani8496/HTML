What is HTML?
------------

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

-> The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
-> The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
-> The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
-> The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
-> The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
-> The <h1> element defines a large heading
-> The <p> element defines a paragraph
