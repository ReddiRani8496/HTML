                The styles specified within the tag is called inline styling.
                The problem with inline styling is if there are huge tags to apply styles then it will be time taken.

Internal styling:
----------------
                The styles specified in head section by using style tag is called internal styling.
                If there are not more than one page of styles, we can choose internal styling.

                The styles specified in the seperate css file, and linked that file in the head section of the html file called External styling.

-------
        To specify the borders for the content we can apply borders.

        borders : radius style color

        We can also specify border in seperate lines as:

        border-radius : radius;
        border-style : style
        border-color : color

Padding:
-------
        Padding is the space between the content inside the border and border.
